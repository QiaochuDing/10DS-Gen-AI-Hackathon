**Problem statement:**

Spotlight is an existing tool used in government to perform checks on grant applicants. Â£40 billion is spent annually on General Grants, so it's crucial that awards are made as effectively and efficiently as possible. 

The current tool requires manual checking of Excel downloads, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive. 

**Our solution:**

Using Gen AI, we have created a solution to improve decision-making efficiency and improve fraud and risk management capabilities.

1. Time savings - a summary narrative is presented on screen, removing the need for downloading risk profiles in Excel.
2. Usability - this is supplemented with recommended actions, making Spotlight easier to navigate for new users.
3. Safer checks - risk profiles are enriched with web data, including latest news reports.
4. User control - an interactive assistant, giving the user greater control and confidence in their assessments.

We estimate that our solution will leverage Gen AI to reduce hours of manual checking to mere minutes, while maintaining the integrity of fraud checks. The solution integrates machine capabilities, while preserving human experience and contexual knowledge.
